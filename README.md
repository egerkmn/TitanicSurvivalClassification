# TitanicSurvivalClassification

This project is prepared for a Kaggle Competition called "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". I tried to solve a binary classification problem with a detailed EDA and XGBoost Algorithm. More details are given in the Jupyter Notebook. Kaggle competition and code links are given below.

If you found this project helpful, some Kaggle upvotes would be very much appreciated!
